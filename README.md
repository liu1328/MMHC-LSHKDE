# Introduction
This project includes the structural learning of Bayesian networks and the classifier of Bayesian networks.


MILSH-KDE: Mainly for the calculation of mutual information and conditional mutual information.
Directed: Using a search algorithm and scoring function.
network: Draw the network structure.
MMPC: Mainly identifies the network skeleton.
MMHC: Orientation is based on the network skeleton.
BNC: Bayesian network classifier constructed by MMHC-LSHKDE
